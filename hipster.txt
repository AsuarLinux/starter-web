You start in a mode called “normal mode”. You can’t immediately type anything.

In order to get typing press i (stands for insert). This will bring you to “insert mode”, so named because in this mode you can actually type.

When you are done typing press esc. This will bring you back to “normal mode”.

In order to save your work you want to type :w and press return. And in order to exit vim you want to type :q and press return. Because saving and quitting is a very common action, there is actually a shortcut :x, which stands for :wq (which just combines :w and :q).
When you run git commit, you will be presented with a text editor that lets you edit the descriptive message for that commit. Unfortunately, Git may choose a default text editor that is unexpected and unintuitive.
Every Git commit has an author, the name and email address of the person who wrote the code. Especially when working on a team project, you should make sure your Git commits include your correct name and email.
